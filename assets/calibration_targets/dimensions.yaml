# Calibration Target Dimensions
#
# Physical dimensions of the calibration target for accurate 3D reconstruction.
# These values MUST match the actual printed/measured dimensions.

target:
  name: charuco_6x9_a4
  
  # Total dimensions (mm)
  width_mm: 270    # 9 squares × 30mm
  height_mm: 180   # 6 squares × 30mm
  
  # Individual element sizes (mm)
  square_size_mm: 30.0
  marker_size_mm: 22.5
  
  # Border around the pattern (mm)
  border_mm: 15.0
  
  # Print scale (1.0 = 100%)
  print_scale: 1.0

  # Notes
  notes: |
    Standard 6x9 ChArUco board designed for A4 paper (210×297mm).
    Actual pattern area is 270×180mm, fits with 15mm margins.
    
    IMPORTANT: After printing, measure the actual square size and update
    this file if there is any deviation. A 1% error in square size
    translates to 1% error in estimated distances.

# Printing instructions
printing:
  paper_size: A4
  orientation: landscape
  scale: 100%
  
  # Recommended materials
  substrate: |
    Use rigid, flat material (foam board, aluminum composite).
    Avoid paper that can buckle or curve.
  
  # Recommended mounting
  mounting: |
    Mount target on a flat, rigid backing.
    Ensure target is planar (no warping).
