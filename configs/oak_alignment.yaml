# OAK-D Depth Alignment Configuration
#
# This file documents the depth alignment settings used during calibration.
# These settings are recorded in the rig.yaml artifact for reproducibility.

# Depth alignment to RGB
depth_alignment:
  # Whether depth is spatially aligned to RGB camera frame
  aligned_to_rgb: true
  
  # Output resolution for aligned depth
  output_width: 1280
  output_height: 720

# Stereo depth configuration
stereo:
  # Stereo mode: "standard", "extended", or "subpixel"
  mode: standard
  
  # Enable subpixel disparity for higher depth precision
  subpixel_enabled: true
  
  # Enable left-right consistency check for quality filtering
  lr_check_enabled: true
  
  # Confidence threshold (0-255, higher = more confident)
  confidence_threshold: 200
  
  # Median filter size (0, 3, 5, or 7)
  median_filter: 5

# Additional notes for documentation

  Default OAK-D S2 depth alignment configuration.
  Depth is aligned to the RGB camera frame for easier fusion.
