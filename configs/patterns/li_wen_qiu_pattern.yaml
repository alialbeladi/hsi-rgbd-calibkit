# Li-Wen-Qiu Right-Triangle Calibration Pattern
#
# Pattern geometry for the cross-ratio-based line-scan camera calibration
# method from Li, Wen, Qiu (Optical Engineering, 2016).
#
# The pattern lies in the Z=0 plane in pattern coordinates.
# Each feature line is defined as ax + by + c = 0.

name: li_wen_qiu_right_triangle

# Dimensions used in cross-ratio formulas (Eqs 11-12)
dimensions:
  wp1: 0.100  # Width parameter 1 (meters) - spacing to L5/L6
  wp2: 0.050  # Width parameter 2 (meters) - spacing to L3/L4

# 6 feature lines in pattern coordinates
# Line format: [a, b, c] where ax + by + c = 0
#
# The pattern consists of:
# - L1, L3, L5: Horizontal lines (parallel to X-axis)
# - L2, L4, L6: Diagonal lines (parallel to each other)
#
# This creates a right-triangle-like pattern where:
# - L1 passes through origin (Y=0)
# - L3 is at Y=wp2 (0.05m)
# - L5 is at Y=wp1 (0.10m)
# - L2 is the diagonal X=Y
# - L4 is X=Y+wp2
# - L6 is X=Y+wp1

feature_lines:
  L1: [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]        # Y = 0 (X-axis)
  L2: [1.0, -1.0, 0.0]       # X - Y = 0 (diagonal through origin)
  L3: [0.0, 1.0, -0.050]     # Y = 0.050 (wp2)
  L4: [1.0, -1.0, -0.050]    # X - Y = 0.050 (wp2)
  L5: [0.0, 1.0, -0.100]     # Y = 0.100 (wp1)
  L6: [1.0, -1.0, -0.100]    # X - Y = 0.100 (wp1)

# Notes for pattern fabrication
notes: |
  The physical pattern should be printed or engraved on a flat rigid surface.
  Feature lines should be precisely positioned - errors directly affect calibration.
  Recommended: use high-precision laser cutting or CNC machining.
  
  Coordinate system:
  - Origin at intersection of L1 and L2
  - X-axis along L1
  - Y-axis perpendicular to L1
  - Z-axis out of pattern plane (towards camera)
